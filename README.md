# Orion

**Orion** is a lightweight Agentic IDE desktop application.

## Features

### Agents Tab (default)
- Sidebar with projects and threads
- Add local folders as projects
- Create multiple threads per project (agentic runs)
- Simple chat interface per thread (mock agent for now — easily swappable for real Codex / Claude Code / Cursor agent integrations)
- Status indicators

### Code Tab
- File explorer for any folder or linked project
- Open multiple files as tabs
- Built-in editor with syntax-aware editing (textarea today, ready for full Monaco)
- Save files (Cmd/Ctrl+S)
- Close tabs (Cmd/Ctrl+W)

### Orion Cloud repositories
- Publish any git project to Orion Cloud and push/pull from the shell bar
- Browse and edit the code on Orion Web (Monaco); web edits are real git commits you pull back
- See [docs/orion-cloud-repos.md](docs/orion-cloud-repos.md)

### Architecture
- Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript
- IPC bridge for secure filesystem access (main process)
- Zustand for client state (persisted)
- VSCode-inspired dark theme

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Desktop login targets the Orion Web origin: development (`npm run start`)
defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, packaged builds default to
`https://orioncode.xyz`. Set `ORION_WEB_URL` to override either (the origin
must have Clerk and the desktop auth routes configured).

## Build

```bash
npm run package
npm run make   # produces distributables
```

## Release

Create `.env.release.local` from `.env.release.example`, then run:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

By default this bumps the patch version, builds the current platform/architecture, uploads artifacts to versioned R2 keys under `releases/v<version>/`, and updates `releases/latest.json`.

macOS builds are Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled DMGs. See [docs/macos-signing-release.md](docs/macos-signing-release.md) for local keychain setup and verification commands.

Useful overrides:

```bash
bun run deploy --bump minor
bun run deploy --version 1.2.3
bun run deploy --bump none
```

## Extending

### Real Agents
In `src/App.tsx`, the `sendMessage` function currently simulates replies. Replace the mock logic with calls to:
- Codex CLI
- Claude Code
- Cursor agent
- T3 Code compatible providers

Use child_process or the existing CLI tools via IPC in `src/main.js`.

### Full Monaco Editor
Uncomment the Monaco `<Editor>` component in the Code tab and import from `@monaco-editor/react`. The project is already set up for it (workers + config ready).

### Linting
Monaco + language servers (or simple ESLint worker) can be added to the editor pane.

## Notes
Inspired by T3 Code, OpenAI Codex desktop, and Cursor's agentic views.

Core is deliberately simple: two tabs, projects/threads, file explorer + editor.
