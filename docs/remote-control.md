# Remote control

Drive one Orion instance from another. If machine **A** enables remote control
and pairs with machine **B**, then B can view and drive A's workspace — A's
projects, epics, and threads, with turns actually running on A. The
relationship is one-directional per pairing: B controlling A grants A nothing,
unless A separately pairs the other way.

Off by default. While it is off, nothing listens and nothing connects.

## Using it

**On the machine to be controlled (the host):** Settings → Remote Control →
enable *Remote control*. Press **Generate code** and note the code, plus
either the address and port (LAN/VPN) or the machine ID (internet) shown next
to it. Enabling remote control implies the machine may be controlled — there
is no separate "allow incoming" switch in the UI; pairing codes are what gate
every actual connection. (The engine still honors
`remoteControlSettings.allowIncoming`, which the UI keeps in lockstep with
`enabled`.)

**On the controlling machine:** Settings → Remote Control → enable *Remote
control*, then under "Machines you can control" enter the host's address and
port (or its machine ID, in internet mode) together with the pairing code, and
press **Pair**.

The host now appears in the sidebar under **Machines**, alongside "This
machine". Selecting it replaces the main panel with that machine's workspace:
its projects and threads, a read-only transcript, and a composer that starts or
continues turns *on the host*. Selecting "This machine" — or any local thread,
project, or epic — returns to local work.

Both machines must be signed in to the **same Orion account** the whole time.
Signing out on either end drops every session immediately and stops the
listener.

## Connection modes

*Connect over the internet* (`remoteControlSettings.connectionMode`)
picks how the two machines find each other. It changes nothing about the
encryption, the authentication, or what a controller may do.

| Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Off** — `'direct'` (default) | The host binds a local TCP listener (default port 47615) and the controller dials an address you type. LAN, VPN, or Tailscale. Nothing leaves your network: the engine makes **zero** requests to Orion Cloud's relay, and never even resolves its URL. |
| **On** — `'relay'` | The host additionally holds an **outbound** WebSocket to Orion Cloud's relay and controllers reach it by machine ID. No port forwarding, no inbound firewall rule, no NAT traversal. The host keeps listening locally too. |

In internet mode, the host registers itself (`POST /api/relay/devices`) and
mints a short-lived relay ticket per socket (`POST /api/relay/ticket`), both
authenticated with the desktop account token. Settings shows whether the
machine is currently online at the relay. The control socket carries a
liveness watchdog: the relay pings every 30 seconds, and 75 seconds with no
inbound frame is treated as a half-open socket (sleep/wake, NAT rebind) — the
listener tears it down and reconnects with backoff instead of reporting a dead
connection as online.

Turning internet mode **off does not deregister** the machine: it stays in the
account's machine list at Orion Cloud and shows as offline, so controllers'
lists stay stable. The explicit **Remove from Orion Cloud** action in Settings
(`remote:relayDeregister` → `DELETE /api/relay/devices/:machineId`) is what
deletes the registration; re-enabling internet mode re-registers it (the
listener forgets its cached registration on every stop, so a fresh start
always re-POSTs and revives a soft-deleted row).

**Route choice on the controller** is deliberately boring: direct first when
the machine has a known address, relay second when internet mode is on. No
probing, no racing. A machine paired over the internet has no address stored at
all, so it goes straight to the relay.

## Security model

The protocol lives in `src/main/remote-crypto.js`; the transports it runs over
live in `src/main/remote-transport.js`; the engine and its policy live in
`src/main/remote-control.js`.

**The relay is untrusted, and is not part of the security boundary.** It is a
byte pipe that splices two WebSockets and forwards opaque chunks of the exact
same stream a TCP socket would carry. Every guarantee below is produced by the
two peers and holds unchanged over it: the relay cannot read the traffic,
forge it, replay it, or impersonate either machine. What a hostile relay *can*
do is drop or delay bytes — which is what any network can do. Relay-side
authorization (tickets, machine ownership) is defense in depth on top of that,
never a substitute for it.

Only relay tickets are ever shown to the relay: short-lived, single-socket,
scoped to one machine, and useless as account credentials. The desktop account
bearer token goes to Orion Cloud's API and nowhere else — never to the relay,
never to a peer. A peer only ever receives an account *proof* bound to that
connection's challenge and to the host's machine ID.

**Pairing.** The host shows a single-use 16-character code (~78 bits over a
30-symbol unambiguous alphabet). Both sides run an ephemeral X25519 exchange
and derive keys with HKDF-SHA256 over `ECDH-shared-secret || PSK`, salted with
a hash of the full handshake transcript (both raw messages, so protocol
version, mode, and device id are all bound into the keys). Each side then
proves it holds the PSK by MACing the transcript. A man-in-the-middle without
the code cannot produce either confirmation. The code expires after 10 minutes,
is retired the moment one pairing completes, and is cancelled after 5 failed
*confirmations* — connection attempts that never prove anything don't count,
so a stranger cannot burn codes the user generates. Success mints a 256-bit
per-device secret stored on both ends.

**Sessions.** The same handshake keyed by the stored device secret. Ephemeral
keys per connection give forward secrecy. After the handshake, frames are
AES-256-GCM with independent keys per direction and strictly incrementing
counter nonces — a replayed, reordered, or tampered frame kills the connection
rather than being skipped.

**Account gating.** After the code-authenticated handshake, the host sends a
fresh random account challenge. Orion Cloud mints the controller a short-lived
proof bound to that challenge and the host machine id, then verifies it for the
host. The desktop bearer token never goes to the peer, and a claimed user id is
not treated as authentication. The host compares the verified account with its
own freshly re-checked live session. Session handshakes re-resolve the device
*and* re-check the live account at the confirm step, not just when the
connection opened — so a connection parked mid-handshake cannot outlive a
revoke or a sign-out. Revoking, signing out, or turning the listener off
destroys every inbound connection, handshaking ones included.

**Anti-abuse.** Unauthenticated connections are capped globally (32) and per
source address (6), and are held to a 4 KB frame budget until encryption is up
— the 8 MB budget needed for transcripts is only granted to authenticated
peers. Failed handshakes are rate-limited per IP. Unknown device ids continue
the handshake against a random secret so failures are indistinguishable and
device ids cannot be enumerated. Inbound relay streams enter through the
*identical* code path as accepted TCP sockets, so all of the above applies to
them unchanged; because a relay stream has no meaningful source address they
share a single bucket, which throttles a relay-borne flood like a flood from
one IP. The host also refuses to open more than 12 concurrent relay streams
that have not yet been handed to the handshake, so a broken or hostile relay
cannot make the process open sockets without bound.

**At rest.** Device secrets are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` in
packaged builds and written 0600 through a temp-file rename. Packaged builds
refuse to persist secrets without OS-backed encryption and say so in Settings
rather than silently losing pairings. Development builds store them
unencrypted (the stock Electron signature can't match the keychain ACL), same
tradeoff the account token already makes.

**What a controller can do.** Read the host's project/epic/thread list, read a
thread's transcript, start a turn, and stop a turn. There is no filesystem,
shell, or settings access over the wire. Turns are executed by the *host's own
renderer* through the same code path as a local user action
(`remote:commandRequest` → renderer → `remote:commandResult`, mirroring the
orchestration subagent bridge). Main dispatches only after that renderer has
explicitly installed its listener; startup and reload clear readiness. The
host's UI and store therefore stay authoritative and every remote action shows
up locally.

## Implementation notes

| Piece | Location |
|---|---|
| Wire protocol (handshake, framing, pairing codes) | `src/main/remote-crypto.js` |
| Transports (TCP + relay WebSockets) | `src/main/remote-transport.js` |
| Engine (server, relay listener, pairing, sessions, persistence) | `src/main/remote-control.js` |
| IPC handlers (`remote:*`), event tap, account hook | `src/main.js` |
| Renderer API | `src/preload.js`, types in `src/types.d.ts` |
| Settings tab | `src/app/RemoteControlSettings.tsx` |
| Sidebar Machines section | `src/app/AgentsSidebar.tsx` |
| Remote workspace view | `src/app/RemoteMachineView.tsx` |
| Host-side command execution | `src/App.tsx` (`remoteCommandHandlerRef`) |
| Settings persistence | `remoteControlSettings` in `src/store.ts` |
| Pairings on disk | `<userData>/orion-remote-control.json` |

Controllers follow live runs through pushed events: the host forwards agent
turn events (`addAgentEventListener` in `src/main/events.js`) and debounced
workspace-change notices, which the remote view uses to refresh — it never
mirrors host state locally, so the two can't diverge.

## Tests

```sh
npm run test:remote-crypto    # handshake, encryption, replay/tamper rejection
npm run test:remote-control   # two real processes over TCP: pairing, sessions,
                              # revocation races, code-burning, flood resistance
npm run test:remote-relay     # two real processes over a local fake relay:
                              # direct mode makes zero relay calls, pairing and
                              # runTurn by machine ID, relay sees ciphertext
                              # only, control-socket reconnect
```

None needs the app running or a network backend — the relay test brings up its
own dependency-free WebSocket relay (`scripts/fake-relay-server.mjs`) that
implements the `/v1/host`, `/v1/connect` and `/v1/stream` contract.

## Transport notes

The relay transport uses the **global `WebSocket`** shipped with Electron's
Node runtime (Node 24 under Electron 42) rather than the `ws` package, which
is not a dependency of this app. Only client sockets are ever needed here —
the desktop never accepts a WebSocket — so the built-in covers the whole
surface, and a security-sensitive path gains no new dependency. The fake relay
in the tests needs a WebSocket *server*, which the global does not provide, so
it carries a small RFC 6455 implementation of its own.
